The implementation of Taylor's series expansions, weighted residuals, variational principles, and integral formulations enable the development of model approximations of electrospun fibers to predict the fiber morphology within the stable region. The mathematical models of the related literature \cite{Feng2002, Gupta2004, Helgeson2008, Hohman2001, Reneker2006, Roozemond2007, Taylor1969, Yarin2011} show promising progress in evaluating the fiber diameter at different values of the processing parameters with high accuracy with an error lower than 8\% \cite{Nagham2017}. The relevant mathematical models show that the fiber diameter increase with increasing $Q$ and concentration, and decrease with decreasing $E$. However, the existing models need further work to include the estimation of other morphological properties such as fiber thickness, and fiber porosity.
