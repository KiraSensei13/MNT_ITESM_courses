abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled.. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity, e, in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt{\%}. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis is the process to thermally decompose an organic material into its carbon backbone in an oxygen-free environment. This process is used in the Carbon-MEMS fabrication technology to carbonize micro-structures patterned on a substrate. The properties of the resulting carbon material are dependent on either the carbon precursor or the pyrolysis conditions. In this work, SU-8 photoresist was used as the carbon precursor to study the effects of three pyrolysis parameters: 1) maximum pyrolysis temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C), 2) temperature ramp rate (2.5°C/min, 5°C/min, 10°C/min, and 20°C/min), and 3) nitrogen flow rate (3l/min, 4.5l/min, 6l/min, and 7.5l/min). To studythe effect of the maximum temperature, the temperature ramp rate and nitrogen flow rate were kept constant to 5°C/min and 6l/min respectively. For the temperature ramp rate experiments, we kept the maximum pyrolysis temperature and nitrogen flow rate constant to 900°C and 6l/min respectively. For the nitrogen flow rate study, the maximum pyrolysis temperature and temperature ramp rate were kept constant to 900°C and 5°C/min respectively. We found that no polymer structures persisted under the following conditions: 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 3l/min nitrogen flow rate. Under these conditions the nitrogen flow rate is not high enough to keep the furnace environment (approximate volume of the furnace tube we used is 6l) entirely inert; in the pyrolysis process, even a small amount of oxygen destroys the intended C-MEMS. All the carbon samples were characterized using 4-point probe measurement for electrical resistivity; confocal microscopy for pore size determination; Raman spectroscopy, electron diffraction x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical characterization. Furthermore, the samples were electrochemically characterized using cyclic voltammetry in a 1mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 and 0.5M KCl solution. The characterization results suggest that samples prepared under the following conditions-900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 6l/min nitrogen flow rate, exhibit the best electrical, physical, chemical and electrochemical properties among the other conditions used.},

The path of the jet is from a fluid surface that is often, but not necessarily constrained by an orifice, through a straight segment of a tapering cone, then through a series of successively smaller electrically driven bending coils, with each bending coil having turns of increasing radius, and finally solidifying into a continuous thin fiber. Control of the process produces fibers with nanometer scale diameters, along with various cross-sectional shapes, beads, branches and buckling coils or zigzags. Additions to the fluid being spun, such as chemical reagents, other polymers, dispersed particles, proteins, and viable cells, resulted in the inclusion of the added material along the nanofibers. Post-treatments of nanofibers, by conglutination, by vapor coating, by chemical treatment of the surfaces, and by thermal processing, broaden the usefulness of nanofibers.},

abstract = {In the electrospinning process, polymer fibers with submicron-scale diameters are formed by subjecting a fluid jet to a high electric field. We report an experimental investigation of the electrically forced jet and its instabilities. The results are interpreted within the framework of a recently developed theory for electrified fluid jets. We find that the process can be described by a small set of operating parameters and summarized through the use of operating diagrams of electric field versus flow rate. In addition, the jet current is related to the net charge density and found to depend on the fluid properties, the applied electric field and the equipment configuration. The net charge density appears to be relatively insensitive to the flow rate, at least for high flow rates. The experiments reveal that a key process in the formation of submicron-scale solid fibers is a convective instability, the rapidly whipping jet. The dependence of this instability on electric field and flow rate, and the exponential nature of its growth rate are in accord with the theory.},

abstract = {Polymer nanofibers, with diameters in the nanometer range, possess larger surface areas per unit mass and permit easier addition of surface functionalities compared with polymer microfibers. Hence, polymer nanofiber mats are being considered for use as filters, scaffolds for tissue engineering, protective clothing, reinforcement in composite materials and sensors. Although some of these applications are in the development stage, a few have been commercially exploited. Research on polymer nanofibers, nanofiber mats, and their applications has seen a remarkable growth over the last few years. However, a review of the various issues related to these nanofibers has not been published. This article presents a review of the recent trends in the processing methods and characterization techniques for polymer nanofibers. Research challenges and future trends in the processing and characterization of polymer nanofibers are discussed in the article. Five processing methods have been examined in this review, namely drawing, template synthesis, phase separation, self-assembly, and electrospinning. Among these methods, electrospinning has been used to convert a large variety of polymers into nanofibers and may be the only process that has the potential for mass production. The structure, morphology, and geometry of nanofibers and the porosity and tensile properties of nanofiber mats can be investigated through conventional techniques and instruments. But new techniques are needed for the mechanical testing of single nanofibers. Although measurement of mechanical properties such as tensile modulus, strength, and elongation is difficult because of the small diameters of the fibers, these properties are crucial for the proper use of nanofiber mats.},

abstract = {The lack of a low cost, high volume method to produce carbon nanotubes has greatly limited their commercialization. Carbon nanofibers have a similar structure and properties as nanotubes and are a commercially viable alternative to them. In recent years many of the difficulties of commercial nanofiber production have been overcome through innovations in their manufacturing process. It is now possible to produce carbon nanofibers of different grades, such as thinner and thicker walled ones, and low heat treated and high heat treated ones. Most significantly, commercial quantities can now be produced of carbon nanofibers that have been surface functionalized with carboxylic acid groups, making them suitable for further functionalization and new classes of applications, such as biomedical sensors and drug delivery. Despite their cost advantages and availability more widespread use of carbon nanofibers has been hampered by uncertainties in their molecular structure and a lack of physical property measurements. However, recent theoretical and experimental studies have addressed these deficiencies showing that these fibers have a cone-helix structure under the usual manufacturing conditions. Additionally, small amounts of a segmented carbon nanotube structure, commonly called a bamboo structure, are also present. When the conical nanofibers were heat treated they were found to transform to a stacked cone structure. Advances in surface functionalization have allowed a variety of groups to be incorporated on them, significantly enhancing their properties and potential applications. Finally, the recent development of a new method to measure the elastic properties and morphology of single nanofibers has clearly demonstrated the high strength of these fibers. These nanofibers now represent a well understood and well characterized graphitic carbon nanomaterial that can be manufactured at low cost in large quantities, and have the potential to bring widespread use of nanotechnology to a variety of fields.},

First, the optimization results of SU-8 under UV lithography are reported.

By optimization, the optimal parameter range and the weighted per cent of a parameter on the final results were determined. For SU-8-5 and SU-8-50, many microstructures with thicknesses of more than 100 and 500 µm and aspect ratios of more than 20 and 50 were obtained with high resolution. The optimization results show that the prebake time plays the key role in the quality, which is different from the previously published results. With the optimization results obtained, some possible applications of SU-8 were developed and demonstrated. These applications included using SU-8 as a structural material for a microfluidic system, as a micromold for electroplating, as a master for plastic hot-embossing, and even as a mask for some wet-etching processes.},

Its chemical structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The prepared compound was cured with diamino diphenyl methane (DDM), diamino diphenyl sulfone (DDS) and m-phenylenediamine (mPDA), respectively. The flame retardant properties, thermal degradation behavior and flame retardant mechanism of the cured CTP-EP were investigated. The LOI values of all cured CTP-EP samples increased from 19.9{\%} for cured diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) to above 30{\%} and successfully passed UL-94 V-0 rating, which demonstrated that the prepared CTP-EP thermoset exhibited excellent flame retardancy. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) test demonstrated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) enhanced from 155 °C for the cured DGEBA to 167 °C for CTP-EP thermoset. The results of thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) tests suggested that the phosphazene group and high aromatic content in CTP-EP thermoset stimulated the dehydration of the matrix at earlier degradation process and the formation of char layer, which retarded the release of pyrolysis gas and enhanced the thermal stability of the cured CTP-EP at high temperature. The cone calorimeter tests (cone) test revealed that heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR), smoke production rate (SPR) and total heat production (TSP) of the cured CTP-EP decreased significantly compared with the cured DGEBA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the phosphazene groups in CTP-EP obviously stimulated the formation of the intumescent, compact and stable char layer, which enhanced the flame retardancy of the matrix during combustion. Consequently, the underlying materials were protected from further degradation and combustion during a fire and result in the efficient flame retardancy of CTP-EP thermoset.},

abstract = {In combination with tapered-trench-etching of Si and SU-8 photoresist, a grayscale mask for deep X-ray lithography was fabricated and passed a 10-times-exposure test. The performance of the X-ray grayscale mask was evaluated using the TERAS synchrotron radiation facility at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Although the SU-8 before photo-curing has been evaluated as a negative-tone photoresist for ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray lithographies, the characteristic of the SU-8 after photo-curing has not been investigated. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet was irradiated by a synchrotron radiation through an X-ray mask, and relationships between the dose energy and exposure depth, and between the dose energy and dimensional transition, were investigated. Using such a technique, the shape of a 26-mu m-high Si absorber was transformed into the shape of a PMMA microneedle with a height of 76 mu m, and done with a high contrast. Although during the fabrication process of the X-ray mask a 100-mu m-pattern-pitch (by design) was enlarged to 120 mu m. However, with an increase in an integrated dose energy this number decreased to 99 mu m. These results show that the X-ray grayscale mask has many practical applications. In this paper, the author reports on the evaluation results of SU-8 when used as a membrane material for an X-ray mask.},

The result is mr-NIL 6000LT: A photochemically curing polymer system for isothermal imprinting by combined thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography. It allows a lower imprint temperature than materials presented previously [C. Schuster, M. Kubenz, F. Reuther, M. Fink, G.

Miller, M. Kubenz, F. Reuther, G. Gr{\"{u}}tzner, Nanoimprinting with SU-8 Epoxy Resists, in: Proceedings of SPIE 6517 2007, 65172A.]. The material system chosen is based on a blend of epoxy resins and a photo acid generator. Such epoxy resists cure during the imprint step in combined thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography. Initiated by UV exposure the cationic polymerisation occurs at elevated temperature forming a polymer pattern with significantly increased thermal stability compared to the uncured system. Apart from the material development leading to mr-NIL 6000LT the correlations between the parameters imprint temperature, exposure time and post exposure hold time are investigated in this work. With the applied resin combination a Tg of −15°C is obtained. This enables the formation of solid films at room temperature after spin-coating and prebake and nevertheless imprint temperatures in the range of 45–50°C, which is a distinct decrease compared to the 100–110°C needed for the previously introduced mr-NIL 6000 [C.

abstract = {An investigation of the structure of carbons of different origin treated at temperatures between 1000 and 3000°C has shown that the graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbons form two distinct and well-defined classes. The differences in structure are apparent from the earliest stages of carbonization, and may be attributed mainly to the formation at low temperatures, in the non-graphitizing carbons, of a strong system of cross-linking uniting the crystallites. This leads to a random orientation of th{\`{e}} crystallites in a rigid, finely porous mass. In the graphitizing carbons the cross-linking is much weaker, the structure is more compact, and neighbouring crystallites have a strong tendency to lie in nearly parallel orientation. It is shown that crystallite growth occurs by the gradual displacement of whole layer-planes or even of groups of layer-planes. The pre-orientation existing in the graphitizing carbons facilitates this process, enabling the rearrangement of the layer-planes to take place by small stages. It is the principal factor favouring crystallite growth in the graphitizing carbons. In the non-graphitizing carbons crystallite growth is impeded both by the strong cross-linking between neighbouring crystallites and by their random orientation.},

It is expected that the jet initiation in NFES is similar to that in cone-jet electrosprays, and can be described with a first principles model. EXPERIMENTS The electrostatic jet initiation of an SU-8 polymeric solution is studied with two different electrode geometries to quantify the initiation parameters and illustrate the optimization of the electric field. A first-principles model is developed to predict and analyze the initiation. FINDINGS Two jet emission mechanisms are identified: one in which the jet is ejected from a free-standing conical meniscus; and one resulting from the contact of the meniscus with the collector, as it evolves from a spherical to a conical shape. Both are triggered by a critical emitter potential. The former produces the thinnest jets with a diameter that depends on the properties of the fluid, while the latter is an alternative to existing mechanical initiation methods. The model reproduces well the experimental phenomena including the critical voltage.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis is the process to thermally decompose an organic material into its carbon backbone in an oxygen-free environment. This process is used in the Carbon-MEMS fabrication technology to carbonize micro-structures patterned on a substrate. The properties of the resulting carbon material are dependent on either the carbon precursor or the pyrolysis conditions. In this work, SU-8 photoresist was used as the carbon precursor to study the effects of three pyrolysis parameters: 1) maximum pyrolysis temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C), 2) temperature ramp rate (2.5°C/min, 5°C/min, 10°C/min, and 20°C/min), and 3) nitrogen flow rate (3l/min, 4.5l/min, 6l/min, and 7.5l/min). To studythe effect of the maximum temperature, the temperature ramp rate and nitrogen flow rate were kept constant to 5°C/min and 6l/min respectively. For the temperature ramp rate experiments, we kept the maximum pyrolysis temperature and nitrogen flow rate constant to 900°C and 6l/min respectively. For the nitrogen flow rate study, the maximum pyrolysis temperature and temperature ramp rate were kept constant to 900°C and 5°C/min respectively. We found that no polymer structures persisted under the following conditions: 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 3l/min nitrogen flow rate. Under these conditions the nitrogen flow rate is not high enough to keep the furnace environment (approximate volume of the furnace tube we used is 6l) entirely inert; in the pyrolysis process, even a small amount of oxygen destroys the intended C-MEMS. All the carbon samples were characterized using 4-point probe measurement for electrical resistivity; confocal microscopy for pore size determination; Raman spectroscopy, electron diffraction x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical characterization. Furthermore, the samples were electrochemically characterized using cyclic voltammetry in a 1mM K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.5M KCl solution. The characterization results suggest that samples prepared under the following conditions - 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 6l/min nitrogen flow rate, exhibit the best electrical, physical, chemical and electrochemical properties among the other conditions used.},

Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

Disc structure is formed where its dimension is affected by the laser fluence. We found that polymer processing using this technique can be categorized into three stages. In the first stage (fluence {\textgreater} 90 J/cm2), lens shaped structure is formed with linear increase in diameter with logarithmic increase in laser fluence. In second stage (fluence {\textgreater} 600 J/cm2), flat-top disc structure is formed and the increase in disc diameter slows down with increasing laser fluence. In the third stage (fluence {\textgreater} 49 kJ/cm2), crater is formed at the centre of the disc due to laser ablation. Moreover, relatively large exposure fluence above the value required for complete polymerization has allowed collateral thermal-polymerization of the surrounding of the disc structure and reduced aspect ratio of the structure. Hence, by controlling laser writing fluence, different structures mentioned above can be produced. This understanding serves as a basis for polymer patterning using the proposed all-fibre laser direct writing technique, which finds potential application in micro-lens array, polymer optical waveguide, photomask and Lab-On-Chip fabrication.},

@article{Sharma2010,
abstract = {A novel method for the direct fabrication of arrays of micropatterned polymeric and carbon nanofiber structures on any substrate is developed. First SU-8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist, is electrospun under optimized conditions to produce a layer of polymeric nanofibers. Next, this nanofibrous mat is micropatterned using photolithography, and finally, pyrolysis produces ordered arrays of microdomains containing carbon nanofibers. The nanotextured surfaces of carbon nanofibers are shown to be very hydrophobic (water contact angle approximately 130 degrees). Micropatterning thus generates a substantial wettability contrast of nanofiber domains with intervening micropatches of very hydrophilic carbon (approximately 20 degrees) or silicon substrates.},

abstract = {A continuous near-field electrospinning (NFES) process has been developed to deposit solid nanofibers with orderly patterns over large areas. Before the onset of electrospinning, a bias voltage is applied to a semispherical shaped polymerdroplet outside of a syringe needle, and a probe tip mechanically draws a single fiber from the droplet to initiate continuous NFES. Contrary to the conventional electrospinning process, we show that decreasing electrical field in continuous NFES results in smaller linewidth deposition, and nanofibers can be assembled into controlled complex patterns such as circular shapes and grid arrays on large and flat areas.},
