When the United Nations established the World Commission on Environment and Development, The UN General Assembly explicitely called attention to two important ideas, they are:

In page 3 of the paper the authors talk about the sources of uncertainty, which of the following in not a factor that they consider as a source of uncertainty in their paper?

The limited funding allocated by governments and international agencies to the analysis of earth system science

(some uncertainties ARE:
* Our lack of scientific knowledge about the natural nature of the biophysical thresholds themselves
* The intrinsic uncertainty of how complex systems behave
* The ways in which other biophysical processes such as feddback mechanisms interact with the primary control variable)


According to the authors, a "boundary" is?

human-determined values of the control variable set at a "safe" distance from a dangerous level.


The planetary boundaries approach rests on three branches of scientific inquiry, they are?

a) The scale of human action in relation to the capacity of the Earth to sustain it

c) The framework of resilience


Out of the nine planetary boundaries considered, for which two, we are not able to determine quantitative boundary levels yet (uncertainty zone)
