Deforestation and lack of uban planning and regulations are well known causes for
biodiversity decrease and species endangerment. Apes are one of the most affected
species by the damage humans have inflicted upon their environment. Orangutans
used to be found across South East Asia, but today they are confined in two islands,
Borneo and Sumatra. In an effort to increase their population numbers and to protect
the forests, planned reforestation is taking place. Key tree species that have proven
to be reliable food sources for orangutans, as well as other tree species that have
shown resilience to climate change and fires.
Reforestations are now being planned by selecting which species to plant as well as where
to plant them to provide a practical and functional environment for apes. Vines for moving
through the forestare and trees they use for nesting are also to be planted. Building these
ecosystems far away from areas accessed by people is also important to maintain the habitat
free from human contact.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is decided to start preparing
the different ecosystems to the conditions they are very propably going to face in a near
future due to climate change. (IUCN, 2019) These measures are a first step towards buffering
the disturbances to the normal conditions of the ecosystem. Nevertheless, these actions must
be complemented by legal regulations and enforced environmental protection policies since
this is the reason the situation has reached this point in the first place.
