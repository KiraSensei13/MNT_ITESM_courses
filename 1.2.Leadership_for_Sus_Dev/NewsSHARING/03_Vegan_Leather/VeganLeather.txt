Rasing animals for leather implies the use of huge amounts of water, land and fuel. Turning skin to leather requieres a lot of energy and hazardous chemicals that threaten our sustainable-development-targets. On the other hand, several workers in factory farming die due to the exposure of hazardous chemicals. "The production of leather hurts animals, the environment, and the workers who manufacture it." (Environmental Hazards of Leather, 2019)

Conventional leather has some flaws in ethical and environmental regards. Forgacs' approach and technique creates a leather-like material wich can be cut, stiched and glued as with conventional leather; moreover, it can take the shape of whatever supports it as it dries. As a sustainable material, "vegan leather" has many advantages. Unnlike conventional leather, Forgacs' leather can be grown with no waste due to undesired pattern shapes or imperfections that appear during the process. The material is made out of colagen produced by yeast in a fermentation process. The yeast is genetically modified using biotechnology to design the organisms and improve the production of the desired proteins that build up the material. These techniques allow a better performance and the creation of the material without consuming so many resources reducing the operation to a bioreactor.
