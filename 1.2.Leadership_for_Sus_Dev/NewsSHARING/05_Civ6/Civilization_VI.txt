With the release of the new SID Meier's "Civilization VI - Gathering Strom" is arguably the most comprehensive implementation of climate change within a video-game mechanics. While climate change has been featured in many titles in the past, it is mostly either as a plot point or as a setting. It is rare for climate change to be used as a game mechanic. (Which is why we find interesting to discuss this new expansion.) 
    For those who do not know how stuff works in Civilization VI, from the year 4000BC to past the year 2000AD, the player can take control of a civilization. The game consists on building and improving cities, training military and non-military units; using the terrain to the player's advantage, by building structures; and then winning by several victory conditions. The player can win the game by winning out the opponents with warfare, by overwhelm them with culture or diplomatically as well.
    Gathering Storm introduces an impressive amount of new content but the most relevant (to this class) is the way that it implements natural disasters and climate change. Briefly, how it works is by the introduction of extreme weather events, these include storms, river floods, droughts and volcanic activity; some have only negative consequences while others have negative and positive aspects. The natural disasters happen regardless of what the player does in the game.
    The more interesting aspect of the game is how it handles climate change. The game splits strategic resources into materials (like iron and horses) and power materials which include things like coal, oil and uranium, as well as being able to build factories in the industrial areas. The player can also build power plants and if the city is well powered then various parts of the city became more productive. For instance, incrementing production by burning fosil fuels; however, it contributes to the CO2 levels in the atmosphere. And increases in the CO2 level can lead to a variety of outcomes.
    The game neatly represents climate change on the screen by showing the climate state within several parameters: increase in global temperature, the percentage of polar ice lost, and the sea level increase. So already we see a multi-faceted implementation of climate change, which is informative. The game also notices the CO2 contributions by civilization and which fuels have been responsible for the most emissions.
    After some gameplays, the impressions are that the system implementation of how human activities force the world's climate is good. The game is very explicit by noticing the player that it is the total amount of carbon dioxide that is been added to the atmosphere is what forces the climate; rather than worrying about a CO2 concentration within a civilization. The total amount of carbon that's been emitted is represented in the game with various stages to climate change going from phase one with just half a meter of sea level rise and going all the way up to phase seven. The implementation of climate phases is cleaver because it represents the real-world effects of climate change, where the effects of CO2 emissions are lagged. That lag is something we see in the real world between emissions and effects, and it is largely because the oceans are absorbing a lot of the carbon, resulting in ocean acidification and much warmer oceans. It is obvious that the seven-phase classification of climate change is not realistic. Increases in global temperature as a result of changes in CO2 levels are mostly felt through changes in the polar ice coverage and changes in the sea level.
    The most impressive aspect of how the game influenced climate change is through the extreme event system. The player can notice that there is actually been an increased chance of storms happening because of increases in the CO2 level in the atmosphere; and this is an aspect of climate change that is not represented very often and is actually one of the most worrying aspects of climate change regarding the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, sandstorms and cold air outbreaks. The game punishes the player by presenting more of these extreme events.
    The most important aspect of the game that needs to be addressed are the changes in human behaviour. In general, the game anticipates the player that there is going to be more human migration and more conflict in a world within the effects of climate change. That behaviour is not programmed into the game, it is just something that happens as a result of human behaviour. On the other hand, the game gives a sense that climate change is an inevitable consequence of human civilization. This is done by indirectly forcing the player to use fossil fuels in the early game. If coal or oil are not used, the player is at a massive disadvantage economically and in the production aspects of the game.
    Of course, Gathering Storm does not get everything right. For instance, the player may expect some natural terrain variability over the time. Also (within the game) nuclear power is treated as a totally green energy, the status of nuclear power of being or not completely carbon free is open up for debate as it depends on how it is defined. Furthermore, as motioned above, the game breaks down climate change into seven phases. By the time the player reaches phase seven, the sea level will have risen three and a half meters with eighty-five percent of the polar ice loss, but there's no real reason why it would just stop. The game could then start introducing things like desertification and further sea level increases.
    Gathering Storm's implementation is a really good way to spread this information out there to the general public. This information is available to the player from the very beginning. Possibly, if we had known the radical effects of burning fuels to further our economies from the very beginning, we would not be in the situation we a are now.
