@book{Ackerman2014,
abstract = {Populations around the world are growing and becoming predominately urban, fueling the need to re-examine how urban spaces are developed and urban inhabitants are fed. One remedy that is increasingly being considered as a solution to inadequate food access in cities, is urban agriculture. As a practice, urban agriculture is beneficial in both post-industrial and developing cities because it touches on the three pillars of sustainability: economics, society, and the environment. Historically, as well as currently, economic and food security are two of the most common reasons for participation in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture not only provides a source of healthful sustenance that might otherwise be lacking, it can also contribute to a household's income, offset food expenditures, and create jobs. Social facets are another reason for populations to engage in urban agriculture. A garden or rooftop farm is a place where people come together for mutual benefit, often enhancing the common social and cultural identity for city residents. Larger urban farms also participate in community enrichment through job training and other educational programmes, many of which benefit underserved populations. Finally, urban agriculture can play an important role in the environmental sustainability of a city. As a form of green infrastructure, urban farms and community food gardens help reduce urban heat island effects, mitigate urban stormwater impacts and lower the energy embodied in food transportation. This paper will describe a multi-year study undertaken by the Urban Design Laboratory at the Earth Institute to assess the opportunities and challenges associated with the development of urban agriculture in New York City (NYC). The paper will present metrics on potential growing capacity within the City inclusive of both rooftop and land-based options, results from a survey of New York City based urban farmers that gathered information on the challenges and barriers to food production in NYC, with a focus on rooftop farming, and data from an environmental monitoring study on a commercial rooftop farm in Brooklyn. The paper will use the results of the multi-year study to provide insight into the potential role of urban agriculture to creating a more sustainable food system for New York City and cities elsewhere.},

abstract = {While urban agriculture has long been valued for providing food security and nutrition within cities, it contributes to many other urban services that are seldom cited as rationales for protecting or even expanding urban food production. Articulating the actual and possible contributions of urban agriculture to municipal sanitation and health services is critical for sustaining these urban farms and their functions into the future. In the context of the low coverage and performance of wastewater treatment plants in Accra, Ghana, health risk reduction measures implemented on and off farm can substitute to a large extent for this absence of conventional wastewater treatment. We estimate that Accra generates approximately 80,000,000L of wastewater per day, of which urban vegetable farms alone use up to 11,250,000L. By mitigating the health risks for farmers and consumers associated with widespread wastewater irrigation, these urban farms have the potential to significantly contribute to the city's sanitation...},

abstract = {Ghana is a typical low-income sub-Saharan African country facing significant sanitation challenges. In Ghana, fresh salads are not part of the normal diet, but have become a common supplement to urban fast food served in streets, canteens and restaurants. In Accra, about 200 000 people consume from such supplements every day. The figure also describes the size of the risk group from contamination, which comprises all income classes including the poor and children. The purpose of this study was to investigate widespread water pollution in urban and peri-urban areas, where 95{\%} of the lettuce consumed in the city is produced. Over 12 months (April 2004-June 2005), lettuce samples from the same production sites in two cities were followed and analyzed along the "farm to fork" pathway for total and faecal coliform (FC) and helminth egg numbers. Questionnaire surveys were conducted among producers, sellers and consumers to quantify lettuce flows to the final risk group. The study identified the farm as the main point of lettuce contamination. Besides the irrigation water, contamination was also attributed to manure application and already contaminated soil. Despite poor sanitary conditions in markets, post-harvest handling and marketing did not further increase the farm-gate contamination levels. To reduce the health risk associated with the consumption of contaminated lettuce; safer farming and irrigation practices are required while the remaining risk could best be addressed where lettuce is prepared for consumption.},

abstract = {The number of urban poor is rapidly increasing as urban population grows. Urban vegetable production is therefore a response to the available market demand and the challenges of unemployment and food insecurity resulting from the urbanisation. The study examined the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' livelihoods in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ashanti Region of Ghana. Descriptive survey design was used for the study. Based on a simple random sampling technique, 300 urban vegetable farmers were selected and interviewed. Cronbach alpha coefficient values showed high reliability and consistency of the farmers' livelihood subscales. The study that the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' livelihoods differed significantly regarding different livelihood subscales (ANOVA). Post-hoc multiple comparisons test (Dunnett's T3) result revealed that the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' mean livelihoods was generally 'low'. However, it contributed 'moderately high' to their natural and physical capitals. The strength of association between farmers' mean livelihood subscales also showed that urban vegetable production impacted differently and significantly on their livelihoods. It is recommended that Farmer Based Organisations (FBOs) should be formed to help empower and protect farmers' from the exploitation of prospective buyers. It would also help address common challenges confronting members including high input cost, lack of credit facilities and inadequate marketing avenues.},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment.},

abstract = {With significant economic development over the last several decades in China, urban land has increasingly sprawled and encroached upon arable land and rural settlements. In this context, this paper explores the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of rural settlement loss and arable land depletion in the process of urban expansion, which could offer a theoretical basis and scientific support for further research of rural development and restructuring. The conclusions of the study are summarized as follows: (1) approximately 80{\%} of urban growth has been at the expense of rural settlements (23.42{\%}) and arable land (57.14{\%}) in Beijing; and (2) an obvious rural non-agriculturization-intensive belt was observed in spatial units from 1985 to 2010, primarily distributed between the Fourth Ring Road and the Fifth Ring Road. Non-agriculturization is defined here as the conversion of land formerly used for agricultural purposes, including rural settlements and arable land, to more densely developed urban uses. (3) The spatial distribution of fastest, fast and medium non-agriculturization began to shift from the northern area to the southern area after 2005. (4) The curves of variation of rural non-agriculturization intensity under urbanization along the urban-rural gradient presented as inverted “U” shapes leading away from the socioeconomic center, while that along the motorways displayed exponential decay. Adhering to the policy of urbanization strategy will be essential for rural restructuring in China.},

abstract = {Agriculture, through its economic, social and ecological functions, presents potentials for meeting some of the targets of the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The targets include: a) reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities (target 11.6), b) providing access to green spaces (target 11.7) and c) promoting resource-use efficiency in cities (target 11b). Nevertheless, cities, especially those in the global south, are struggling to sustain agriculture due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation. How to maintain (peri-) urban agriculture in cities and their peripheries in an era of increasing land scarcity is unclear in the conventional literature. In this regard, this study set out to determine appropriate practices globally that can foster the sustenance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and determine their applicability to the Ghanaian context. Even though Ghana remains the focus of the discussion, the generality of the characteristics of the cities in Sub-Saharan Africa makes the practices useful to Sub-Saharan African region. The study obtained the required data, through a review of literature, from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, MeSH and ProQuest. The authors complemented the literature from these conventional sources with literature from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results of the literature review show that container gardening, backyard gardening, and farming on vacant lands and marginal lands can hold the key to preserving agriculture within the cities. However, these models are more appropriate for the production of vegetables and herbs. Therefore, urban and peri-urban agriculture may concentrate on the production of herbs and vegetables, to complement the food supply from rural agriculture. The Purchase of Development Right and expropriation and zoning of peri-urban land for agricultural purposes appear to be important strategies for promoting access to land for peri-urban agriculture. The strategies call for revisions of city legislation and the land use planning process to legitimise and promote agriculture in cities and their peripheries.},

abstract = {The acute waste management problems, coupled with the proliferation of small scale industries in many developing countries, make low quality water treatment before use inevitable in the long run. These industries have the potential to discharge effluent containing chemicals and heavy metals into the environment. The indiscriminative use of pharmaceutical products by households in many of these countries is another source of health concern. Low quality water treatment in these countries has however been hampered by the high cost of infrastructure provision and maintenance. Cost-sharing among stakeholders appears to be a promising strategy to finance and maintain the wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study therefore, the willingness and ability of urban open space commercial vegetable farmers to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation purposes has been assessed. One hundred open space commercial vegetable farmers and four vegetable farmers' associations were selected and interviewed in Kumasi in Ghana using semi-structured interview schedules and interview guides respectively. The results of the study show that approximately three out of every five vegetable farmers were willing to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation. The results further show that the probability of being willing to pay by farmers who agreed that the current water they used for irrigation was harmful is approximately 5.3 times greater than that of those who did not. The analysis of the farmers' ability to pay revealed that all the farmers would be capable of paying for reclaimed water at a price of US{\$}0.11/m(3). This has implications for land tenure security and vegetable consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for the produce.},
