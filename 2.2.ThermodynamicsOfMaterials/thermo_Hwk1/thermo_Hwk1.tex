Homework 1\\
}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine which of the following systems are in equilibrium.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item A rigid insulated cylinder is divided by an insulated piston into two equal parts. One part contains oxygen at 50 \degree C and 300\,kPa, and the other part contains nitrogen at 30 \degree C and 100\,kPa. The piston is held in place by a stop.
\item Same as part a, but the stop is removed.
\item A rigid insulated cylinder is divided by a copper piston into two equal parts.
One part contains oxygen at 50 \degree C and 300\,kPa, and the other part contains nitrogen at 30 \degree C and 100 \,kPa.
\item A rigid insulated cylinder is divided by a copper piston into two equal parts. One part contains oxygen at 30 \degree C and 100\,kPa, and the other part contains nitrogen at 50 1C and 100 kPa.
\item A rigid insulated cylinder is divided by a copper piston into two equal parts. One part contains oxygen at 30 \degree C and 100 kPa, and the other part contains nitrogen at 30 \degree C and 100 kPa. A small hole is made in the piston.
\item Twenty grams of salt crystals are put in a container together with 1000 cm$^3$ of water.
\item Twenty grams of salt crystals are put in a container together with 1000 cm$^3$ of saturated saline solution.
\end{enumerate}
\item A perpetual motion machine of the first kind (PMM1) is defined as an {\em adiabatic} system for which the work in a cycle is not zero. Is the first law equivalent to the statement that a PMM1 is impossible? Explain.
\item The solar energy can be harnessed to produce electric work. A PV solar panel produces 100\,kW of electric power per day in summer, which is used to charge a storage battery. The battery loses heat to the environment at a rate of 3\,kW. How much energy is stored in the battery after 6\,h of operation?
\item The envelope of an elastic balloon exerts a pressure on its contents proportional to its area. The balloon is inflated from a volume of 10\,L and a pressure of 200\,kPa to a volume of 25 L.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the final pressure in the balloon.
\item Calculate the work of the balloon envelope.
\end{enumerate}
\item For a simple compressible system, indicate whether the following statements are true, sometimes true, or false:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The work done by a system when changes from states 1 to 2 depends on its volume.
\item When a gas expands, its energy increases.
\item The work of an adiabatic cycle is equal to 0.
\item The work in a cycle is equal to 0.
\item The energy change from states 1 to 2 depends on the work of the system.
\item When a gas is compressed in a cylinder, its energy does not change.
\end{enumerate}
\item The specific energy of a certain substance is given by $U = A + BPV$, where $A =
60$\,kJ/kg, $B = 8$, $P$ units are kPa, and $V$ is expressed in in m$^3$/kg. Find the work done by a system of this substance when its volume increases adiabatically from 1.5 MPa and 60 to 150 L.
